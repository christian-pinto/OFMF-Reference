# OpenFabrics Management Framework (OFMF) - Reference implementation

The OFMF Reference implementation provides a basic implementation of the OpenFabrics Management Framework. This project is based (fork) on the [Swordfish API Emulator](https://github.com/SNIA/Swordfish-API-Emulator), that provides the support for interacting with a RedFish/SwordFish system via RESTful operations (create, read, update, and delete). Before contributing to this project, read our [license](https://github.com/OFMFWG/OFMF-Reference/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and make sure you agree with the terms.

The OFMF Reference implementation is maintained by the OpenFabrics Alliance, while the Swordfish API Emulator code is maintained on GitHub by the SNIA.

## Prerequisites for the emulator

The OFMF reference implementation requires Python 3.5 or higher, make sure to properly configure your system before attempting using this project. If not available on your system, please refer to the best practices for installing python onto your operating system.

It is recommended for this project to use virtualenv for separating the emulator environment from the main system python environment. Make sure virtualenv is available as part of your system python environment. Please note, using virtualenv is not a requirement for the OFMF Reference to properly function.

To set up the emulator Python virtualenv and requirements, run:"
```
virtualenv --python=python3 venv
venv/bin/pip install -q -r requirements.txt
```

## Installing the OFMF Reference implementation

### <u>Basic OFMF installation process</u>
We provide a (bash) script that automatically installs and runs the emulator on a Linux system. 
The script will take care of installing all the requirements of the project.

To start the installation process, run:
```
./setup.sh
```

after completion this script will also execute the OFMF that will be listening on port `5050`. Use `CTRL-C` to exit the emulator and return to your shell.

### <u>Customizing the OFMF installation</u>

The `setup.sh` script provides parameters for configuring the installation of the OFMF:
```
./setup.sh -p PORT -n -v
```

The `-p` argument allows the emulator to be started listening on an alternative port. Finally, the `-n` argument is used only for copy new files into the destination folder withour re-installing the entire environment. An example usage for the `-n` argument is when a developer makes changes to one of the files in the project and wants to test the changes. He would modify the source code of any of the files and then run the below command only to update the code base. The `-p` argument will create the virtual environment to separate the emulator environment from the main system environment.

```
./setup.sh -n
```

After a successful installation, the OFMF can be started by running the below commands:

```
python3 ofmf-main.py
```
or if a virtual environement has been set up:
```
venv/bin/python ofmf-main.py
```

## Interacting with the OFMF

Users can interact with the OFMF with any tool, command line or GUI based, that can send HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT) to the below URI:

`http://localhost:5000/redfish/v1/`

An example using `curl`:

```
curl http://localhost:5000/redfish/v1/

{
  "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1",
  "@odata.type": "#ServiceRoot.v1_14_0.ServiceRoot",
  "Chassis": {
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Chassis"
  },
  "Fabrics": {
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Fabrics"
  },
  "Id": "RootService",
  "Links": {
    "Sessions": {
      "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions"
    }
  },
  "Managers": {
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Managers"
  },
  "Name": "Root Service",
  "RedfishVersion": "1.14.0",
  "Registries": {
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Registries"
  },
  "SessionService": {
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/SessionService"
  },
  "Storage": {
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Storage"
  },
  "UUID": "92384634-2938-2342-8820-489239905423"
}

```

Alternatively, users can use a browser to access http://localhost:5000/redfish/v1/ on the system where the emulator has been installed. If the emulator is working properly, the Redfish service root should be displayed on the browser.

## Replicating the SC23 Demo setup

Download the mockups at: https://github.com/OFMFWG/mockups

All the below commands are to be executed from the folder where you have cloned the OFMF-Reference project project.

Configure your virtual environment:

```commandline
$ ./setup.sh -v -n
```
Open one terminal for the server and one terminal for the agent. 
In the server terminal run:
```commandline
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python emulator.py -p 5000 -redfish-path ./Resources/Sunfish \
    -debug -demo-scripts-path path_to_mockups/mockups/sc23_testObjects/scripts
```

In the agent terminal run:
```commandline
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python emulator.py -p 5002 -redfish-path path_to_mockups/mockups/sc23-PoC -debug -agent
```

In both cases replace `path_to_mockups` with whatever path you have cloned the mockups into.

Server and CXL agent are now running. Visit the below links to interact with the demo:
- Server: http://localhost:5000
- CXL Agent: http://localhost:5002
